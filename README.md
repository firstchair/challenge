##### Frontend Recruitment Challenge -- Tommy Hilfiger - Denim Landing

Welcome, you are about to be faced with one of our challenges.

### Tips

##### Keep it in motion

You are provided with a _Motion Example_, a video that showcases UI and UX of a project, it is the foundation of all animations and interactions on the website.

You can find this file at `resources/motion-example.mov`.

Look at it closely, rewind it, pause it, explore it.
You might want to take some time here.

Of course there is a `psd` for your convenience, `resources/design.psd`.


##### Work with the assets

You will have all that you need in the `assets` folder.

This comprises of fonts, images and whatever we think is necessary for you to succeed, which in turn is what we already used to succeed.

For the video you can use `resources/test-video.mp4`.

Small note: if a font is missing, it means you can ignore that one.


##### Write your own

We are not shipping any build system or boilerplate to not tie you up and see how you would approach it.

There is no folder structure or pre-existing code. Everything is up to you, from the `index.html` to the last line of `style`.

Choose your tools wisely and use them smartly; that's also part of the test!



### Assignment

Ok, on to the actual business.

Your assignment for today is to replicate the intro of the homepage of a website we have already built.

In this particular case it is the landing page of the _Tommy Hilfiger_'s _Denim_ campaign website.

You can mock data like copy, but everything should look and function as showcased in the _Motion Example_.



You have to provide the structure, style, animations and custom logic.

This includes:

- HTML structure, CSS styling and JS logic.
- Animations for text, images and blocks.
- Custom video player with custom controls.


Have fun!
